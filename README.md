## About
This is a personal project to create a discord bot that allows you to know which is the best build against an specific champion in league of legends.

## How to install
1. As this was created for personal use, first, you should register a discord bot in https://discord.com/developers/applications.
2. Copy the credentials and store them in a .env file.
3. Add the bot to a discord channel where you have admin permissions.
4. run main.py
5. In discord, type <code>!builder [name of the champion you're playing] [optional: name of the champion you're playing against]</code>

After that, it should give you the build that you should use for the champ you're playing aganist in the chat!
Thanks :).

## NOTES
This is still in development and some new features will be added like new languages, maybe images of the items you need to buy and more.
